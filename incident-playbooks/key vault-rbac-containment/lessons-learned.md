# Lessons Learned

## Sentinel Limitations

- Incident payload ≠ alert payload
- Identity attribution requires logs
- Automation rules require precise conditions

## Logic App Realities

- Arrays must be handled explicitly
- ARM APIs fail silently without permissions
- Managed Identity debugging is non-trivial

## Security Design Principles Applied

- Least privilege
- Human-in-the-loop
- Non-destructive containment
- Full auditability
