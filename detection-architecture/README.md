# Detection Architecture

This folder explains **how security signals are selected and interpreted**, not just which alerts exist.

## Principles

- Control-plane signals first
- High signal > high volume
- Drift detection over noise
- Architecture-aligned detections

## Signal Sources

- AzureActivity
- Network configuration changes
- DevOps approval events
