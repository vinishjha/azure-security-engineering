# Landing Zone Architecture

This folder defines the **foundational security architecture** for a regulated Azure environment.

It establishes:
- Subscription boundaries
- Identity trust zones
- Network exposure rules
- Centralized logging
- Blast-radius containment

All detection, DevSecOps, and governance controls depend on this architecture.
