## Goal

Demonstrate identity security engineering using Conditional Access, PIM, and Sentinel.

## Why this matters

In regulated environments, identity controls are Tier-0. This project shows how identity guardrails are:
- designed (CA + PIM configuration),
- monitored (Sentinel),
- operationalized (incidents + safe automation),
- and validated with evidence.
