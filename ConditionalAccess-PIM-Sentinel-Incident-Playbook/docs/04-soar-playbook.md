## SOAR philosophy (safe automation)

This project demonstrates controlled SOAR for identity incidents.

Playbook behavior:
- Adds a structured incident comment using expressions
- Applies consistent tags for triage and reporting

No automatic remediation is performed to avoid Tier-0 blast-radius risk in a portfolio environment.
