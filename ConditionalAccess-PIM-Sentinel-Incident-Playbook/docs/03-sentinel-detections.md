## Analytics rules

This project uses custom scheduled analytics rules built from tenant-validated AuditLogs events.

Detections:
- Tier-0 CA drift
- PIM privileged activation
- Permanent privileged role assignment (standing privilege)

KQL sources are stored in `/kql` and rule configuration screenshots are under `/screenshots/04-sentinel-analytics-rules`.
