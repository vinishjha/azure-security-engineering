# Activity Log Forwarding (Prod → Central LAW)

## Goal
Ensure control-plane operations from `sub-prod-workload` are visible in the central security workspace (`law-central-security`) where Microsoft Sentinel is enabled.

## Implementation
Configured an Activity Log diagnostic setting on `sub-prod-workload` to send categories including Administrative and Policy to the central Log Analytics workspace.

## Why
- Centralized audit trail across subscriptions
- Required for detecting policy denials, RBAC changes, and deployment events
- Enables incident creation and investigation in Sentinel/Defender
